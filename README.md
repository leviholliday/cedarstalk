# cedarstalk

One database and one API over everything I have collected about Cedarville: the
student directory, the course catalog, the printed academic catalog, harvested
booklists, and the campus itself.

This fork only renames it and adds packaging around it (the access registry,
the launchers and setup page, a few extra routes, the mobile page), and those
changes were made with [Claude](https://claude.com/claude-code). Same MIT
license, unchanged, still Kieran's copyright.

## What's this?

Four projects had four data files and none of them could see each other.
`cedarstalk-raycast` swept the directory into `directory.db`.
`the-cedarville-app` crawled Colleague and the printed catalog into
`catalog.sqlite` and `book-2026-2027.json`. `cedar-major-pipeline` harvested
campus-store booklists and guessed majors off them, reaching across to the
other two by absolute path. `assassins` drew the campus off OpenStreetMap.

Every question worth asking crosses at least two of those. Which dorm has the
most engineers. Whether the person who moved into Lawlor over the summer
changed majors too. How far a freshman actually walks in a day. Kept in four
files those need application code; kept in one they need a `JOIN`.

So this is one SQLite database, one Bun server in front of it, and collectors
for each source. It also keeps history — every source upstream is a snapshot
API, and who arrived, who left, who moved and who dropped a course only exists
if you write it down each time you look.

## The easy way

Go to [cedarstalk.netlify.app](https://cedarstalk.netlify.app), download, and get a token.

- **Windows:** run the *cedarstalk Windows installer*. It installs into your user folder,
  adds a **cedarstalk** shortcut to the Desktop, and starts it.
- **Mac:** open the download (a tidy `cedarstalk` folder) and double-click **Start on Mac**.

Then paste your token into the page that opens. It shows exactly which folder to load as the
browser extension (which then connects itself and starts syncing), and the launcher offers to
add the Raycast commands -- or double-click **Add to Raycast** later.

The first time, macOS or Windows warns the launcher is from an unidentified developer: on a Mac,
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway; on Windows, More info → Run anyway. Keep the
window that opens running while you use it.

The download is built by `scripts/build-package.sh` (run by a GitHub Action on every push) from
committed files only, and published as the `cedarstalk.zip` asset on the `latest` release.

## Running it

```bash
bun install
cp .env.example .env        # fill in BEARER_TOKEN -- see below, it has to come from the registry
bun run engine import       # seed from the older projects, if they are checked out beside this
bun run dev                 # http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

`BEARER_TOKEN` has to be one issued at
[cedarstalk.netlify.app](https://cedarstalk.netlify.app) --
see [Running your own copy](#running-your-own-copy). Every instance,
including this one, validates against that registry before it will start at
all; a self-generated string will not work.

The dashboard is at `/`, the spec at `/openapi.json`, and every other route
wants `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. It binds loopback unless you tell it
otherwise, which you should think about before doing: this database holds ten
thousand real people's rooms, phone numbers and inferred majors.

## Collecting

```bash
bun run engine collect catalog 2027SP   # a term of sections and courses
bun run engine collect catalog --all    # every course that exists, offered or not
bun run engine collect book             # the printed catalog, ~340 pages
bun run engine collect campus           # OpenStreetMap plus the campus tour
bun run engine collect directory        # the whole directory (needs a session)
```

The catalog, the book and the map need nobody's permission — Colleague's course
search, the publisher's page HTML and Overpass are all public. The directory is
different: it is behind SSO, so `collect directory` needs a session cookie, from
`DIRECTORY_COOKIE`, from `--cookie <file>`, or from the signed macOS helper that
`cedarstalk-raycast` already installs.

Booklists need a real browser, because the campus store sits behind an AWS WAF
challenge. Two ways:

```bash
bun run engine harvester 2027SP         # a Tampermonkey script, ids baked in
bun run engine ingest ~/Downloads/2027SP.json
```

...or the extension, which is the better answer.

## The sync extension

`extension/` is an unpacked Chrome extension that keeps the database current
from the browser you are already signed into. Load it at
`chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked, then paste the engine
URL and the bearer token into its popup and press Save.

It does no thinking of its own. It asks `/v1/sync/manifest` what is missing,
runs those directory queries and booklist fetches with your own cookies, and
posts the results back. Which name prefixes are still hiding rows, which
students have no booklist yet, when a sweep has seen everybody — all of that
stays on the server, so the extension never needs updating when the sweep logic
gets smarter. It runs itself every twelve hours by default.

## Guessing majors

The campus store's booklist leaks `Department / Course / Section` for every book
it wants to sell. Collected across the population and merged over terms, that is
a course fingerprint, scored against all 79 degree programs by TF-IDF cosine:
gen-eds everybody takes count for nothing, major-specific courses dominate.

```bash
bun run engine guess "First Last"
bun run engine guess --all --out guesses.csv
bun run engine labels data/labels/honors.csv   # known majors, for scoring
bun run engine evaluate                        # logs accuracy to the metrics table
```

From one term of mostly-shared coursework it is a reliable **cluster**
classifier (~75%) and a weak fine-grained one (~25% exact): it cannot split
MechE from CompE when they share the freshman core. More semesters is the fix,
and `evaluate` logs every run so the climb is visible.

## Schedules

The major model throws the section number away, because which lab slot somebody
drew says nothing about what they study. For one question it says everything:
`BIO-2500-01` is a row in the catalog, and that row carries the days, the hour
and the room. So a list of books nobody meant to publish as a timetable is a
timetable.

```
GET /v1/people/:id/schedule?term=2026FA
```

Sections with times and rooms, a Monday-to-Friday week with contact minutes per
day, credits summed off the catalog, online sections held apart from the ones
that meet, and the sections a booklist named that the catalog has never heard
of. It is only as current as the last harvest — a course dropped in week three
sits there until a sweep sees it gone, and `/v1/people/:id/history` is where
that movement is written down. A section nobody assigned a book to never shows
up at all.

## The map

`collect campus` pulls building outlines and every footpath, stair and service
drive off OpenStreetMap, then anchors each one to the graph node nearest its
edge — a door, near enough.

Three sources, in order of how much they know. OpenStreetMap draws most of it.
The halls OSM never traced come from Cedarville's own campus tour, whose
polygons are fitted to real coordinates through its sixty-odd GPS markers. What
neither has — the College View blocks, Cedar Park, the operations yard — is
pinned in `src/collect/assets/pins.tsv`, positioned by fitting the university's
printed campus map against the fifty buildings already placed, which lands
within about eight metres across thirty-one anchors. Every pin carries a note
saying where it came from.

Two things worth knowing about that. The bounding box is drawn generously on
purpose: the obvious box around the academic core cuts off the townhouses, the
residence-life centres and the operations yard, which is three hundred people.
And the directory's own name for a building is often nobody else's — Gromacki
Hall is the 2013 townhouse OSM still calls "Townhouse 2" — so
`src/collect/assets/buildings.tsv` maps the directory's shorthand onto the name
each source uses, with fuzzy matching as the fallback rather than the rule.

`/map` draws it: outlines in SVG, the walking graph underneath, buildings shaded
by how many people are listed there, or by hall gender, or by which class holds
the plurality. Pinned buildings are drawn as points rather than invented
footprints, and the ones sharing a position — the four College View blocks, the
three OPS shops — are one marker that breaks back down on hover.

Since everybody in the directory already carries a dorm or an office, that is
all it takes to put the whole population on the map:

```
GET /v1/campus/occupancy?by=class
GET /v1/campus/route?from=Printy%20Hall&to=Engineering%20and%20Science%20Ctr
GET /v1/people/:id/location
```

## History

Every collector writes down what changed rather than only what is:

```
GET /v1/history/events?kind=vanished
GET /v1/history/events?field=dorm_name
GET /v1/history/population
GET /v1/history/churn
GET /v1/people/:id/history
```

One rule worth knowing: only a sweep that asked the whole name space can retire
anybody. A resumed sweep skips the queries an earlier run finished, so most
people were never asked about — retiring on that would graduate the whole
school. `collect directory --refresh` is the one that counts.

## On your phone

`/mobile` is a small, separate page from the dashboard -- three things, one
screen each: the quietest free rooms, a person's location right now, and who
is scheduled to be in a building. It shares the dashboard's token gate, so the
same bearer token unlocks both.

**Reach it over Tailscale, never publicly.** This holds real students' dorm
rooms and daily movements; it does not belong on the open internet under any
circumstances -- no ngrok, no port forwarding, no Tailscale Funnel. Install
Tailscale on the machine running the engine and on the phone, then set:

```bash
HOST=<the machine's own tailnet IP or MagicDNS name>   # not 0.0.0.0
```

and open `http://<that address>:3000/mobile` from the phone. `HOST` binds the
server to that one address and nowhere else -- a stronger guarantee than a
firewall rule, since there is no other interface for it to be listening on.

Also useful: an iOS Shortcut can call the API directly over the same tailnet
(`GET /v1/people/:id/location/now` with the bearer token in the header) for a
one-tap Home Screen button, no browser needed.

## Running your own copy

`data/` never leaves the machine it was collected on -- it isn't
in this repo, and nothing in it is shared by pointing another instance at his.
The only thing distributed is the engine itself, empty, for you to fill with
your own data from your own login.

**1. Get a token.** [cedarstalk.netlify.app](https://cedarstalk.netlify.app)
asks for your name, your `@cedarville.edu` email, and what you're running
this on. It checks the email *looks like* a Cedarville address -- it does not
send a verification email, because nobody's set up an account for that yet.
The real gate is downstream: the token is only useful for an engine that
itself needs a genuine Cedarville Self-Service login to collect anything, so
a fake email gets you a token and nothing else.

This step is not optional. Every instance of this engine -- the maintainer's own
included, registered the same way as anyone else's -- validates its token
against that registry before it will start at all, and every 30 minutes
after that while it runs. A self-generated `BEARER_TOKEN` will not work; see
[`src/lib/access-registry.ts`](src/lib/access-registry.ts) for exactly what
gets sent (a bare request count, never which endpoints or who was looked up)
and what a brief registry outage does and does not block.

**2. Set it up.**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leviholliday/cedarstalk.git
cd cedarstalk
bun install
cp .env.example .env
```

Paste the token you were issued as `BEARER_TOKEN` in `.env`. Nothing else to
configure -- the registry address is fixed in the engine itself, not an
environment variable, so there is nowhere to point it somewhere else or leave
it unset.

**3. Sign into Self-Service once, then collect.**

```bash
bun run engine collect directory --refresh   # first sweep, from scratch
bun run engine collect catalog               # this term's course catalog
bun run dev                                  # http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

The directory sweep opens a real browser window for you to sign in through
Cedarville's SSO. After that it can run unattended -- see
[Collecting](#collecting) below for the headless path once you're set up.

**Windows.** The headless directory sweep
(`scripts/headless-directory.sh`) defaults to a Swift helper that only
compiles on macOS. On Windows, use the cross-platform path instead:

```bash
bun run scripts/auth-session.ts <cookie-file>   # first run: pass HEADED=1 and sign in
bun run engine collect directory --cookie <cookie-file>
```

The Raycast commands work on Raycast for Windows too -- all except live
directory search, whose sign-in window is a Swift app and so Mac-only. `/`
and `/mobile` (see [On your phone](#on-your-phone)) work in any browser, which
covers Linux.

## Hosting

Kieran's own setup, kept from the original: same as everything else he runs,
a systemd user service and a Caddy entry.

```bash
bun run build                       # -> dist/cedarstalk
cp cedarstalk.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user enable --now cedarstalk
```

```caddy
http://cedarengine.dunkirk.sh {
        bind unix/.cedarengine.dunkirk.sh.webserver.sock|777
        reverse_proxy :38455
}
```
