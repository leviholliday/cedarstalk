/**
 * The longitudinal half of the engine.
 *
 * Every upstream source here is a snapshot API: ask it today and it tells you
 * about today. Who moved dorms over the summer, which class actually
 * graduated, whether someone dropped a course three weeks in — none of that
 * exists upstream, and all of it is recoverable if you write down what changed
 * each time you look. So sweeps are logged, diffs are logged, and the current
 * row is treated as the latest frame rather than the truth.
 *
 * "Vanished" is the one claim that needs care. A person missing from a partial
 * sweep is not gone, they are unlooked-at. Only a run that claims to have seen
 * everybody can retire a row, which is what `complete` on a sweep records.
