/**
 * One student's week.
 *
 * The join is short but it only works because of a detail the major model
 * discards: the campus store's booklist names the *section* a book was bought
 * for, not just the course. `BIO-2500-01` is one row in the catalog, and that
 * row carries the days, the hour and the room. So a list of books somebody
 * never meant to publish as a timetable is a timetable.
 *
 * Two honest limits. A booklist is only as current as the last harvest, so a
 * course dropped in week three sits here until the next sweep sees it gone —
 * `/v1/people/:id/history` is where that movement is recorded. And a section
 * with no assigned book never appears at all: this is the schedule the
 * bookstore knows about, which is most of it and not all of it.
